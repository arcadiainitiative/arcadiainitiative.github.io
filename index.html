<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>My name is Tiernan Lindauer, and I wanted to ask you a question:</p>
<p>What's the most powerful thing in the world?</p>
<p>The answer: Groups of people. Specifically, groups of young adults that are smart, passionate, and creative.</p>
<p>Motivated groups of young adults have turned us from a bunch of hunter-gatherers to that of a prosperous democratic
    and technological society.</p>
<p>Over the past year, I've been searching for other high-talent individuals. But a combination of all three of these
    factors is very rare, even among the most prestigious scholarship groups and student organizations
    (of which I am a part of). To address this, I've decided to form The Arcadia Initiative.</p>
<p>My goal is to collect as much ultra-high-quality talent as possible & work on something awesome together.</p>
<p>What that "something" is, I don't know yet (I've got a few ideas, but nothing solid). But I'm confident that with the
    right people, we can figure it out.</p>

<h3>Why Join?</h3>
<p>My vision for The Arcadia Initiative is for it to be much more than a social club. I want to build companies, perform
    research, and innovate together. But I know from experience that I can't do it alone. If you want to do something
    great, greater than anything you've ever done before, I invite you to apply using the link below.</p>
<p>I also have quite a few high-profile connections, and can secure significant funding for research and
    development.</p>
<p>Other organizations have a clearly defined purpose. If you're interested in robotics or satellites or computer
    science, you apply to join. If not, you don't bother. Other organizations/groups are filled mostly with the
    following types:</p>
<ul>
    <li>People who do well academically but have no additional drive, no desire to pave a new path</li>
    <li>People who got lucky (nepotism or otherwise)</li>
    <li>The fuckboys who do well academically but don't take anything seriously, not even their fantasies of grandeur
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you're one of these types, don't apply. We don't want you.</p>
<h3>Who We Are Looking For</h3>
<p>If you <em>are</em> interested in building/thinking up something incredible and are both very good at your field
    and very passionate, we're looking for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Programmers</strong>: Pretty much every aspect of modern science interacts with programming at some
        level. They're essential for almost any project, and we're particularly looking for those with a strong math
        background.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Engineers</strong>: Most of the entrepreneurial world in the past twenty years has been on the software
        side, but there's plenty more innovation left in the real world. It's just harder, but it is there. If you're
        truly passionate about building and innovating in the real world, consider reaching out.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Physicists</strong>: Lots of math and a broad understanding of how things work, including atypical
        things,
        (nuclear/quantum physics) is excellent.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Mathematicians</strong>: We're not looking for someone who's really good at calculus, per se, we're
        looking for someone who is highly creative and understand applied mathematics
    </li>
</ul>
<p>While these fields are designed to be our primary focus, we're open to exceptional individuals from any discipline
    who can contribute unique perspectives and talent to our projects. Keep in mind: we're not looking for dead weight.
    You're not going to skate by, only doing only sales and marketing or writing documentation like in other
    organizations.</p>
<p>An added benefit to experience in the aforementioned disciplines is a good grasp of english, both reading and
    writing.
    Oftentimes, these are the smartest individuals anyways, because reading really is the best thing you can do to get
    smarter. Regardless, you flat-out think (and communicate) better if you have experience reading and writing,
    so we're looking for that too.</p>
<h3>Organization Details</h3>
<p>The Arcadia Initiative is a small, selective organization that will initially be capped at five (or fewer)
    members.</p>
