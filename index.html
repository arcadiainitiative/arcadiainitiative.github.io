    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>If you're like me, you probably find college easy. And while student organizations are great, they are often laden with bureaucracy and time-wasting. Even among the most prestigious scholarship recipients at our university, I have sometimes been disappointed.</p>

    <h3>What We Offer</h3>
    <p>At the Genesis Forum, we plan to collaborate on a variety of innovative projects and initiatives. I have access to significant funding to support experimenting with your ideas. Our goal is to foster an environment of intellectual stimulation, cross-disciplinary learning, and collaborative problem-solving.</p>

    <h3>Who We're Looking For</h3>
    <p>We're actively seeking highly talented and motivated individuals, with a particular focus on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programmers:</strong> Those who can code proper solutions to complex problems, from AI algorithms to system architectures.</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematicians:</strong> Minds that can unravel abstract concepts and apply them to real-world challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Physicists:</strong> Thinkers who can bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these fields are our primary focus, we're open to exceptional individuals from any discipline who can contribute unique perspectives to our projects. Whether you're an excellent student who's bored with your studies or a "genius" who may not be the best student, we welcome you to join us.</p>

    <h3>Organization Details</h3>
    <p>The Genesis Forum is a small, selective organization that will initially be capped at five (or fewer) members. Hours are flexible, and the group may evolve over time as we work together on ambitious projects and initiatives.</p>

    <h3>How to Join</h3>
    <p>If you're interested in joining the Genesis Forum, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to learn more about the application process and opportunities available. Be prepared to demonstrate your intellectual prowess and innovative thinking.</p>
