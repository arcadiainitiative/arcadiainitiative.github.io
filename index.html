      <h2>The Genesis Forum</h2>
      <p><b>An organization like no others. Members like no others.</b></p>

      <p>If you're like me, you probably find college easy. And the student organizations are great, but they are often laden with bureaucracy and time-wasting. Even among the most prestigious scholarship recipients at our university, I have sometimes been disappointed.</p>

      <p>I've been looking for other highly talented and highly motivated individuals to work with. If you have been too, consider contacting us below. We aim to bring together Texas A&M's best and brightest minds, regardless of your major or previous experience.</p>

      <p>At the Genesis Forum, we plan to collaborate on a variety of innovative projects and initiatives. I have access to significant funding to support experimenting with your ideas. Whether you're an excellent student who's bored with your studies or a "genius" who may not be the best student, we welcome you to join us.</p>

      <p>Our goal is to foster an environment of intellectual stimulation, cross-disciplinary learning, and collaborative problem-solving. You'll have the opportunity to work alongside other high-IQ, high-talent, and high-motivation individuals, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.</p>

      <p><b>Just who are you, exactly?</b></p>
      <p>My name is Tiernan Lindauer, and I am currently a sophomore (senior by hours) here at Texas A&M. I am pursuing a dual degree in computer science and physics, and I have the following credentials:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Two patents pending</li>
        <li>Founder of LindauerAI, an AI-based educational technology startup</li>
        <li>Texas A&M Brown Scholar & President's Endowed Scholar ($103,000+ in scholarships)</li>
        <li>Triple Nine Society Member (World's largest 145+ high-IQ organization)</li>
        <li>Engineering Honors</li>
        <li>1540 SAT, 35 ACT</li>
        <li>4.0 GPA at TAMU</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Organization Details</b></p>
      <p>The Genesis Forum is a small, selective organization that will initially be capped at five members. Hours are flexible, and the group may evolve over time as we work together on ambitious projects and initiatives.</p>

      <p>If you're interested in joining the Genesis Forum, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to learn more about the application process and opportunities available.</p>
