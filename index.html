    <h2>The Genesis Forum</h2>
    <p><b>An organization like no others. Members like no others.</b></p>
    <p>If you're like me, college is (relatively) easy for you.</p>
    <p>The other orgs are great -- but as I've found, they are laden with bureaucracy and time-wasting. Even at the most elite scholarship tiers in our university, I am oftentimes disappointed.</p>
    <p>I've been looking for other highly talented and highly motivated individuals to work with. If you have been too, consider contacting us below.</p>
    <p>But working on what? Excellent question.</p>
    <p>Whatever we put our minds to -- I have plenty of ideas, but would love your input.</p>
    <p>Perhaps you aren't the best student, but you are a genius. Join us.</p>
    <p>If you're an excellent student and bored with your studies, join us.</p>
    <p>If you want to meet other high-IQ, high-talent, and high-motivation people, join us.</p>
    <p>We are looking for Texas A&M's best and brightest. Doesn't matter your major, or previous experience, or GPA (but those certainly help).</p>
    <p>I have acess to significant funding for experimenting with any ideas you have.</p>
    <p><b>What about you? Who are you?</b></p>
    <p>My name is Tiernan Lindauer, and I am currently a sophomore (senior by hours) here at Texas A&M. I am purusing a dual degree in computer science and physics. Here's my credentials:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Triple Nine Society Member (World's largest 145+ high-IQ org)</li>
      <li>Two patents pending</li>
      <li>Founder of LindauerAI, an AI-based educational technology startup</li>
      <li>Texas A&M Brown Scholar & President's Endowed Scholar</li>
      <li>Engineering Honors</li>
      <li>1540 SAT, 35 ACT</li>
      <li>4.0 GPA</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Organization specifics</b></p>
    <p>Hours are flexible. It will start out as a low-intensity organization but may develop into something out.</p>
